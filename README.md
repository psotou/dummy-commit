Because sometimes you just want to start start your checks/pipelines with a fresh new pushed change.

`dummy-committer` will add a comment at the end of your README file and turn it on or off accordingly. Plus, it'll add a commit with commit message `dummy commit` if it fails to find a commit with the phrase `dummy commit` inside the commit message of any commit of your current branch.

## TODO

- [ ] Improve README description and usage.
- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Add github actions.
